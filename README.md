# Paint by Movement
This is a project I created for a class called Coding for Live Performance to demonstrate my knowledge real-time image processing in Processing. My goal was to create an interactive that is aesthetically pleasing and encourages movement. A background image is saved by clicking the screen while no users are in front of the camera. New pixels are painted to the screen whenever they are different from both the background and the previous frame. The color spectrum is defined by two RGB values which are customizable.
